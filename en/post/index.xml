      <title>Preparing for the New Semester</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;-week-from-july-23-to-july-29&#34;&gt;ðŸ“Œ Week from July 23 to July 29&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vacation is reaching its midpoint, and I decided to do a bit of preparation for the upcoming semester. I made a list of subjects to be studied and found several online courses to deepen my knowledge in databases and analytics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also disassembled my laptop, cleaned the cooling system, and updated some software â€” now the equipment is ready for new workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little by little, I can feel the anticipation of returning to the university atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Trip to Nature</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;-week-from-july-16-to-july-22&#34;&gt;ðŸ“Œ Week from July 16 to July 22&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week was spent outdoors â€” my friends and I went out of town. Tents, a campfire, evening conversations, and a starry sky â€” exactly what was needed after an intense academic year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the day, we swam in the lake and went boating, and in the evening, we experimented with a bit of campfire cooking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trips like this help to reset and return to tasks with renewed energy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Summer Projects and Self-Development</title>
      <link>https://ZiynatulloSharofiddinov.github.io/en/post/03/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;-week-from-july-9-to-july-15&#34;&gt;ðŸ“Œ Week from July 9 to July 15&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, I started working on a small project â€” a chatbot for automating simple tasks. Iâ€™m using Python and a library for message processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Iâ€™m reading a book on algorithms that I didnâ€™t manage to fully cover during the semester. Itâ€™s fascinating to see how the theory studied at the university is now applied to real-world problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the vacation is in full swing, I try to dedicate a couple of hours a day to studying and practice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>First Day of Vacation â€” Long-Awaited Rest</title>
      <link>https://ZiynatulloSharofiddinov.github.io/en/post/02/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;-week-from-july-2-to-july-8&#34;&gt;ðŸ“Œ Week from July 2 to July 8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exam session has finally ended, and the long-awaited summer vacation has begun. The very first thing I did was simply sleep in without an alarm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met up with friends in the park â€” we walked around and recalled the funniest moments of the past semester. The weather is perfect â€” itâ€™s the best time for walks and trips out of town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iâ€™ve planned a few small programming projects for July to stay in shape, but for now, Iâ€™m just enjoying my free time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Session â€” Final Push Before the Holidays</title>
      <link>https://ZiynatulloSharofiddinov.github.io/en/post/01/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;-week-from-june-25-to-july-1&#34;&gt;ðŸ“Œ Week from June 25 to July 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The week was spent in full concentration mode â€” the exam session was in full swing. The exams in economics and computer science turned out to be more challenging than expected: I had to dedicate a lot of time to reviewing lectures and solving past yearsâ€™ problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The algorithms exam was especially memorable â€” one of the tasks involved code optimization, and the solution came literally a couple of minutes before the end. The adrenaline was off the charts!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the fatigue, thereâ€™s a real sense of satisfaction from the work done. Only a couple more subjects left â€” and then I can finally relax.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>First Day of Vacation â€” Long-Awaited Rest</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;-week-from-july-2-to-july-8&#34;&gt;ðŸ“Œ Week from July 2 to July 8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exam session has finally ended, and the long-awaited summer vacation has begun. The very first thing I did was simply sleep in without an alarm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met up with friends in the park â€” we walked around and recalled the funniest moments of the past semester. The weather is perfect â€” itâ€™s the best time for walks and trips out of town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iâ€™ve planned a few small programming projects for July to stay in shape, but for now, Iâ€™m just enjoying my free time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Session â€” Final Push Before the Holidays</title>
      <link>https://ZiynatulloSharofiddinov.github.io/en/post/01/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;-week-from-june-25-to-july-1&#34;&gt;ðŸ“Œ Week from June 25 to July 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The week was spent in full concentration mode â€” the exam session was in full swing. The exams in economics and computer science turned out to be more challenging than expected: I had to dedicate a lot of time to reviewing lectures and solving past yearsâ€™ problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The algorithms exam was especially memorable â€” one of the tasks involved code optimization, and the solution came literally a couple of minutes before the end. The adrenaline was off the charts!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the fatigue, thereâ€™s a real sense of satisfaction from the work done. Only a couple more subjects left â€” and then I can finally relax.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;-week-from-july-16-to-july-22&#34;&gt;ðŸ“Œ Week from July 16 to July 22&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week was spent outdoors â€” my friends and I went out of town. Tents, a campfire, evening conversations, and a starry sky â€” exactly what was needed after an intense academic year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the day, we swam in the lake and went boating, and in the evening, we experimented with a bit of campfire cooking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trips like this help to reset and return to tasks with renewed energy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>First Day of Vacation â€” Long-Awaited Rest</title>
      <link>https://ZiynatulloSharofiddinov.github.io/en/post/02/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;-week-from-july-2-to-july-8&#34;&gt;ðŸ“Œ Week from July 2 to July 8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exam session has finally ended, and the long-awaited summer vacation has begun. The very first thing I did was simply sleep in without an alarm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met up with friends in the park â€” we walked around and recalled the funniest moments of the past semester. The weather is perfect â€” itâ€™s the best time for walks and trips out of town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iâ€™ve planned a few small programming projects for July to stay in shape, but for now, Iâ€™m just enjoying my free time.&lt;/p&gt;
